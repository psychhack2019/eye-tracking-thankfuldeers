A within subjects (n = 44), one-way multiple analysis of variance was conducted to explore the impact previous presentations has on the number of fixations and the mean pupil size.
There was a statistically significant difference in mean pupil size based on the number of image occurrences, F (1, 43) = 9.293, p < .01.
This difference is primarily driven through the difference between pupil size at first presentation.

There was no statistically significant difference in fixation number based on the number of image occurrences, F(1, 43) = 0.9446, p = 0.331.
