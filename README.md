1. Install the required dependencies
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Run code
```
$ python app.py
```

## Dataset available for UofT PsychHacks2019

pupil_data.csv.zip: Contains sample report extracted from Eyelink (R) 1000 at frequency of 20Hz for 48 participants.

**Study design**:</br>
Participants view face images for 6 blocks and perform a remember-know-new (RKN) recognition task in the last 3 blocks.

Study blocks 1-2 (60 trials in each block): Exposure-I (60 face images presented twice)<br/>
Study blocks 3-5 (40 trials in each block): Indirect Test (60 face images from Exposure-I presented for the 3rd time and 60 new face images presented once)<br/>
Study block 6 (60 trials): Exposure-II (60 face images that were presented for the first time in Block 3-5, presented once again)<br/>

Test blocks 1-3 (40 trials in each block): Direct Test (60 face images from Exposure-II that were presented twice before and 60 new face images presented once)<br/>
