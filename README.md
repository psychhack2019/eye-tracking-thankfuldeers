# DeersEyeTrack
Psychhack2019 project on Eyetracking Dataset, by Team ThankfulDeers.

## Development Setup
This project is written in Node.js, R and Python3.7 environment. Please make sure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), [R](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) and [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is installed properly.

## Usage
User can follow the following steps to analyse the eye tracking data.
### Clean dataset
There is a sample dataset available in `data` directory, dataset details are in `Dataset available for UofT PsychHacks2019` section.

User can also use there own dataset as long as it follows the same format as the sample dataset and is in the `data` directory.

User can follow the following instructions to clean a dataset:

1. Make sure [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is installed properly.

2. Install the required dependencies.
```
$ cd eye-tracking-thankfuldeers/data
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run code. Can replace pupil_data.csv.zip with your own dataset name. If user doesn't provide the name of dataset, the code will defaultly run on sample dataset.
```
$ python cleaner.py pupil_data.csv.zip
```

4. Once cleaner finishes successfully, there should be a file named "cleanedEyeDat.csv" created in `data` directory, which will be used in the following analysis. 

### Analysis Data
Now user can use the R script provided in `script` directory to analyse the cleaned data (generated in previous section, data/cleanedEyeDat.csv). User should make sure [R](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) is installed properly.

Once the script completed, 3 plots will be generated in `static/img` directory.

### Display result (Sample dataset only)
There is a simple web application written for display all the results for sample dataset. User can run it using the following instructions:

1. Make sure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is installed properly.

2. Install the required dependencies.
```
$ cd eye-tracking-thankfuldeers
$ npm install
```

3. Run the web application locally.
```
$ node app.js
```

4. Now user can access the web application via
```
http://[ip address of user computer]:3000
```

## Dataset available for UofT PsychHacks2019

pupil_data.csv.zip: Contains sample report extracted from Eyelink (R) 1000 at frequency of 20Hz for 48 participants.

### Study design
Participants view face images for 6 blocks and perform a remember-know-new (RKN) recognition task in the last 3 blocks.

Study blocks 1-2 (60 trials in each block): Exposure-I (60 face images presented twice)<br/>
Study blocks 3-5 (40 trials in each block): Indirect Test (60 face images from Exposure-I presented for the 3rd time and 60 new face images presented once)<br/>
Study block 6 (60 trials): Exposure-II (60 face images that were presented for the first time in Block 3-5, presented once again)<br/>

Test blocks 1-3 (40 trials in each block): Direct Test (60 face images from Exposure-II that were presented twice before and 60 new face images presented once)<br/>
