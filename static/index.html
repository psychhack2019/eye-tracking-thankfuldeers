        <p>
            A within subjects (n = 44), one-way multiple analysis of variance was conducted to explore the impact previous presentations has on the number of fixations and the mean pupil size.
        </p>
        <p>
            There was a statistically significant difference in mean pupil size based on the number of image occurrences:
        </p>
        <p class="formula">F(1, 43) = 9.293, p &lt .01.</p>
        <p>
            This difference is primarily driven through the difference between pupil size at first presentation.
        </p>

        <p>
            There was no statistically significant difference in fixation number based on the number of image occurrences: 
        </p>
        <p class="formula">F(1, 43) = 0.9446, p = 0.331.</p>
